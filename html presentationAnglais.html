      <h3>School</h3>
      <p><img id=imgP src="pontarlier.png">I did my college as well as my high school in Pontarlier,<img id="imgP2" src="lxm.png"> at the Lycée Xavier Marmier, in première I took the specialties physics chemistry digital computer science and life and earth science, then in terminal I kept NSI and SVT.
        I'm currently training at the iut in colmar in network and telecommunication. I chose network and telecommunication, after having been to the open door in Montbéliard, I preferred colmar to Montbéliard thanks to the dev-cloud training present in colmar but not in Montbéliard.
